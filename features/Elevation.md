# Elevation Feature Implementation

## Overview

The elevation feature has been successfully implemented across the entire residential design tool, allowing objects to be placed at different heights above or below the ground plane. This feature provides full 3D capabilities for creating realistic terrain and multi-level designs.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Store Types Update

- Added `elevation?: number` property to all object types in `storeTypes.ts`
- Elevation values are stored in meters, with 0 being ground level
- Supports values from -5m to +5m for practical design constraints

### 2. Geometry System Enhancement

- Updated `GeometryConfig` interface to include elevation support
- Modified geometry generation functions to respect elevation settings
- All geometry types (roads, walls, water) now properly render at specified elevations

### 3. Object Rendering Updates

- **Roads**: Roads now render at their specified elevation, maintaining proper connections
- **Walls**: Walls are positioned at their elevation, with proper height calculations
- **Water**: Water surfaces render at their elevation with proper transparency
- **Buildings**: Building floors and roofs are offset by elevation value
- **Trees**: Tree trunks and foliage are positioned at their elevation

### 4. UI Controls Integration

- Added elevation sliders to all object property panels:
  - Road Panel: Elevation control (-5m to +5m)
  - Wall Panel: Elevation control (-5m to +5m)
  - Water Panel: Elevation control (-5m to +5m)
  - Building Panel: Elevation control (-5m to +5m)
  - Tree Panel: Elevation control (-5m to +5m)
- Real-time preview of elevation changes
- Visual feedback with current elevation values

### 5. File Structure Changes

The geometry system has been reorganized into separate modules for better maintainability:

```
src/components/objects/geometry/
├── types.ts                    # Type definitions
├── bezierUtils.ts             # Bezier curve utilities
├── pathUtils.ts               # Path generation utilities
├── boundsUtils.ts             # Bounds calculation utilities
├── roadGeometry.ts           # Road geometry generation
├── wallGeometry.ts           # Wall geometry generation
├── waterGeometry.ts          # Water geometry generation
├── previewGeometry.ts        # Preview geometry generation
├── genericGeometry.ts        # Main geometry orchestrator
└── index.ts                  # Export definitions
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating Elevated Roads

```typescript
const elevatedRoad = {
  type: "road",
  points: [
    { x: 0, z: 0 },
    { x: 10, z: 0 },
  ],
  elevation: 2.5, // 2.5 meters above ground
  width: 6,
  // ... other properties
};
```

### Creating Multi-Level Structures

```typescript
const elevatedBuilding = {
  type: "building",
  position: [5, 0, 5], // x, y, z position
  elevation: 3.0, // 3 meters above ground
  floors: 5,
  // ... other properties
};

const groundLevelWater = {
  type: "water",
  position: [10, 0, 10], // x, y, z position
  elevation: 0, // at ground level
  radius: 3,
  // ... other properties
};
```

## Technical Specifications

### Elevation Range

- **Minimum**: -5.0 meters (below ground)
- **Maximum**: +5.0 meters (above ground)
- **Precision**: 0.1 meter increments
- **Default**: 0.0 meters (ground level)

### Geometry Considerations

- Roads maintain proper connections when elevated
- Walls respect elevation for proper alignment
- Water surfaces render correctly at any elevation
- Building components are properly offset by elevation
- Tree components scale appropriately with elevation

### Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact as elevation is handled during geometry generation
- No additional runtime calculations required for rendering
- Efficient bounds calculation
